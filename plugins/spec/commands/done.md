Mark current plan as complete and optionally commit changes.

## Step 0: Select Plan

If argument provided: `/done plan-name` - use that plan

If no argument:
1. Get all plans sorted by completion percentage (100% first)
2. If no plans exist, report error
3. If only one plan, auto-select it
4. If multiple plans, use **AskUserQuestion tool**:
   ```
   question: "Which plan do you want to mark as done?"
   header: "Complete Plan"
   options:
     - label: "feature-auth (100% complete) ✅"
       description: "Add authentication system. All tasks complete."
     - label: "refactor-api (95% complete)"
       description: "Refactor API layer. 19/20 tasks complete."
     - label: "add-tests (50% complete)"
       description: "Add test coverage. 10/20 tasks complete."
   ```

## Step 1: Verify Plan Completion

Read `.spec/plans/{plan-name}/plan.md` and verify completion status:

1. Run `/refresh {plan-name}` logic to check all tasks
2. Verify all phases have ✅ markers
3. Count total completed vs total tasks

If plan is not fully complete:

- Report incomplete status (X/Y tasks complete)
- Use **AskUserQuestion** tool:
  ```
  question: "Plan is only X% complete. What would you like to do?"
  header: "Incomplete Plan"
  multiSelect: false
  options:
    - label: "Mark done anyway"
      description: "Archive incomplete plan as-is"
    - label: "Continue working"
      description: "Resume with /go {plan-name}"
    - label: "Cancel"
      description: "Don't mark done, keep as active"
  ```
- If user chooses "Continue working", exit and suggest `/go {plan-name}`
- If user chooses "Cancel", exit without changes
- If user chooses "Mark done anyway", continue to Step 1.5

## Step 1.5: Detect Worktree Context

Extract worktree and branch information from plan metadata:

```bash
# Extract metadata
PLAN_BRANCH=$(grep "^- \*\*Branch\*\*:" .spec/plans/{plan-name}/plan.md | sed 's/^- \*\*Branch\*\*: //' | sed 's/ *$//')
PLAN_WORKTREE=$(grep "^- \*\*Worktree\*\*:" .spec/plans/{plan-name}/plan.md | sed 's/^- \*\*Worktree\*\*: //' | sed 's/ *$//')
BASE_BRANCH=$(grep "^- \*\*Base Branch\*\*:" .spec/plans/{plan-name}/plan.md | sed 's/^- \*\*Base Branch\*\*: //' | sed 's/ *$//')
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null)

# Check if worktree exists and is set
HAS_WORKTREE=false
if [ -n "$PLAN_WORKTREE" ] && [ "$PLAN_WORKTREE" != "(none)" ]; then
  if [ -d "$PLAN_WORKTREE" ]; then
    HAS_WORKTREE=true
  fi
fi

# Store for later steps
```

Store these values for use in subsequent steps:
- `PLAN_BRANCH` - Branch associated with plan
- `PLAN_WORKTREE` - Worktree path (or "(none)")
- `BASE_BRANCH` - Base branch (usually main)
- `CURRENT_BRANCH` - Current git branch
- `HAS_WORKTREE` - Boolean flag if worktree exists

## Step 2: Offer to Commit Changes

Use **AskUserQuestion** tool:

```
question: "Would you like to commit the changes from plan '{plan-name}'?"
header: "Create Commit"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "Yes, create commit"
    description: "Draft commit message and create git commit"
  - label: "No, skip commit"
    description: "Archive plan without committing"
  - label: "Cancel"
    description: "Don't mark done, exit without changes"
```

- If "Yes": Proceed to Step 3
- If "No": Skip to Step 4 (Archive)
- If "Cancel": Exit without changes

## Step 3: Create Git Commit (if requested)

If user wants to commit:

1. Check git status to see what changed:

   ```bash
   git status
   git diff
   ```

2. Draft a commit message based on the plan objective and completed tasks:

   - Use the plan's objective as the basis for the commit message
   - Include plan name in commit message
   - Example: "feat: complete add-authentication-system plan"
   - Summarize the key changes from all phases
   - Follow conventional commit format if appropriate
   - Include the standard footer

3. Show the proposed commit message to the user

4. Use **AskUserQuestion** tool:
   ```
   question: "Does this commit message look good?"
   header: "Confirm Commit"
   multiSelect: false
   options:
     - label: "Yes, create commit"
       description: "Create commit with this message"
     - label: "Let me edit it"
       description: "Provide a different commit message"
     - label: "Skip commit"
       description: "Don't commit, go to archive"
   ```

   - If "Yes": Create the commit
   - If "Let me edit it": Ask user for preferred message (text input), then create commit
   - If "Skip commit": Skip to Step 4

5. Create the commit with all changes from the plan

## Step 3.5: Offer to Create Pull Request (if applicable)

If plan has a branch that's different from base branch, offer to create PR:

**Check if PR creation is applicable:**
```bash
SHOULD_OFFER_PR=false
if [ -n "$PLAN_BRANCH" ] && [ "$PLAN_BRANCH" != "(none)" ] && [ "$PLAN_BRANCH" != "$BASE_BRANCH" ]; then
  # Check if gh CLI is available
  if command -v gh >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    # Check if branch has remote tracking
    if git rev-parse --abbrev-ref "$PLAN_BRANCH@{upstream}" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      SHOULD_OFFER_PR=true
    else
      # Offer to push branch first
      echo "Branch '$PLAN_BRANCH' has no remote tracking. Push before creating PR."
      SHOULD_OFFER_PR=false
    fi
  fi
fi
```

**If PR creation is applicable:**

Use **AskUserQuestion** tool:
```
question: "Would you like to create a pull request for branch '$PLAN_BRANCH'?"
header: "Create Pull Request"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "Yes, create PR"
    description: "Create PR from '$PLAN_BRANCH' to '$BASE_BRANCH'"
  - label: "Push branch and create PR"
    description: "Push branch to remote and create PR"
  - label: "No, skip PR"
    description: "Continue without creating PR"
```

**If user selects "Yes, create PR":**

1. Extract plan objective for PR description
2. Draft PR title from plan name and objective
3. Create PR body with plan summary:

```markdown
## Summary
[Plan objective - 2-3 bullet points]

## Implementation
This PR implements the plan defined in `.spec/plans/{plan-name}/plan.md`

**Completed:**
- All {N} phases complete
- {M} tasks completed
- Tests passing ✅

## Plan Details
- Plan: {plan-name}
- Branch: {PLAN_BRANCH}
- Base: {BASE_BRANCH}

See .spec/plans/{plan-name}/plan.md for full implementation details.

🤖 Generated with Claude Code /spec:done
```

4. Create PR using gh CLI:
```bash
gh pr create \
  --base "$BASE_BRANCH" \
  --head "$PLAN_BRANCH" \
  --title "feat: {plan objective summary}" \
  --body "$PR_BODY"
```

5. Capture PR URL and report to user

**If user selects "Push branch and create PR":**

1. Push branch to remote:
```bash
git push -u origin "$PLAN_BRANCH"
```

2. Then follow same PR creation flow as above

**If user selects "No, skip PR":**

Continue to next step without creating PR.

**Error Handling:**
- If gh CLI not available, skip this step with message
- If push fails, report error and don't create PR
- If PR creation fails, report error but continue to next step

## Step 4: Archive Completed Plan

Archive the plan to `.spec/plans/archive/`:

1. **Determine Archive Path:**
   - Get current date: YYYYMMDD
   - Archive path: `.spec/plans/archive/{plan-name}-{YYYYMMDD}/`

2. **Check for Collision:**
   - If archive directory exists, append time: `{plan-name}-{YYYYMMDD}-HHMM`

3. **Move Plan to Archive:**
   - Move entire directory: `.spec/plans/{plan-name}/` → `.spec/plans/archive/{plan-name}-{YYYYMMDD}/`
   - This includes plan.md, implementation/ directory, and execution-log.md

4. **Update README.md:**
   - Remove plan from Active Plans section
   - Add to Archived Plans section with branch context:
   ```markdown
   ### {plan-name} (Completed {YYYY-MM-DD})
   - **Description**: [from plan]
   {if PLAN_BRANCH != "(none)"}
   - **Branch**: {PLAN_BRANCH} 🌿 {if branch deleted}(deleted){endif}
   {endif}
   {if PLAN_WORKTREE != "(none)"}
   - **Worktree**: {if removed}(removed){else}{PLAN_WORKTREE}{endif}
   {endif}
   - **Progress**: Y/Y tasks (100%)
   - **Archive Path**: `.spec/plans/archive/{plan-name}-{YYYYMMDD}/`
   ```

   **Implementation Notes:**
   - Include branch info if plan had a branch
   - Note if branch was deleted during cleanup
   - Note if worktree was removed during cleanup
   - Preserve this info for historical reference

## Step 4.5: Offer Worktree Removal (if applicable)

If plan had a worktree, offer to remove it:

**Check if worktree removal is applicable:**
```bash
if [ "$HAS_WORKTREE" = "true" ]; then
  # Worktree exists, offer removal
  SHOULD_OFFER_REMOVAL=true
else
  SHOULD_OFFER_REMOVAL=false
fi
```

**If worktree removal is applicable:**

**Validate Clean State:**

Before removing worktree, check for uncommitted changes:
```bash
# Check worktree status
if git -C "$PLAN_WORKTREE" status --porcelain | grep -q .; then
  # Worktree has uncommitted changes
  echo "⚠️  Warning: Worktree has uncommitted changes"
  git -C "$PLAN_WORKTREE" status --short

  # Ask user what to do
  read -p "Remove worktree anyway? Uncommitted changes will be lost! [y/N]: " confirm
  if [ "$confirm" != "y" ] && [ "$confirm" != "Y" ]; then
    echo "Worktree removal cancelled. Clean up manually later."
    SHOULD_REMOVE_WORKTREE=false
  else
    SHOULD_REMOVE_WORKTREE=true
  fi
else
  # Worktree is clean
  SHOULD_REMOVE_WORKTREE=true
fi
```

**If worktree is clean or user confirmed removal:**

Use **AskUserQuestion** tool:
```
question: "Would you like to remove the worktree for this plan?"
header: "Clean Up Worktree"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "Yes, remove worktree and keep branch"
    description: "Remove worktree at '$PLAN_WORKTREE', keep branch '$PLAN_BRANCH'"
  - label: "Yes, remove worktree and delete branch"
    description: "Remove worktree and delete branch '$PLAN_BRANCH' (use after PR merged)"
  - label: "No, keep worktree"
    description: "Leave worktree in place for manual cleanup later"
```

**If user selects "Yes, remove worktree and keep branch":**

1. Check if in worktree directory:
```bash
if [ "$(pwd)" = "$(realpath $PLAN_WORKTREE)" ]; then
  echo "Error: Cannot remove worktree while inside it"
  echo "Please cd to project root first: cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
  # Don't remove, but don't exit - just warn
  WORKTREE_REMOVED=false
else
  # Remove worktree
  git worktree remove "$PLAN_WORKTREE"
  echo "✓ Removed worktree at $PLAN_WORKTREE"
  WORKTREE_REMOVED=true
fi
```

2. Update plan.md metadata in archive to reflect worktree removed:
```bash
# In archived plan.md, update Worktree line
sed -i '' 's/^- \*\*Worktree\*\*:.*/- **Worktree**: (removed)/' .spec/plans/archive/{plan-name}-{YYYYMMDD}/plan.md
```

**If user selects "Yes, remove worktree and delete branch":**

1. First remove worktree (same as above)

2. Then delete the branch:
```bash
if [ "$WORKTREE_REMOVED" = "true" ]; then
  # Check if branch is merged
  if git branch --merged "$BASE_BRANCH" | grep -q "^  $PLAN_BRANCH$"; then
    # Branch is merged, safe to delete
    git branch -d "$PLAN_BRANCH"
    echo "✓ Deleted branch $PLAN_BRANCH (was merged to $BASE_BRANCH)"
  else
    # Branch not merged, force delete
    echo "⚠️  Warning: Branch '$PLAN_BRANCH' is not merged to '$BASE_BRANCH'"
    # Ask for confirmation
    read -p "Force delete branch? [y/N]: " confirm
    if [ "$confirm" = "y" ] || [ "$confirm" = "Y" ]; then
      git branch -D "$PLAN_BRANCH"
      echo "✓ Force deleted branch $PLAN_BRANCH"
    else
      echo "Branch $PLAN_BRANCH kept"
    fi
  fi
fi
```

**If user selects "No, keep worktree":**

Skip removal and continue.

**Error Handling:**
- If worktree removal fails, report error but continue
- If branch deletion fails, report error but continue
- If user is in worktree directory, warn but don't block completion

## Step 5: Confirm Completion

Report to user:

```
Plan "{plan-name}" marked as complete! ✅

Commit: [Created/Skipped]
Archive: .spec/plans/archive/{plan-name}-{YYYYMMDD}/

View archived plan with: cat .spec/plans/archive/{plan-name}-{YYYYMMDD}/plan.md

Ready to start your next plan with /new
```
