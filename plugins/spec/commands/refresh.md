Review existing plan and update checklist status.

## Step 0: Select Plan

Check for plan name argument: `/refresh plan-name`

If not provided:
1. Read `.spec/plans/README.md` to get all active plans with Last Updated timestamps
2. Sort plans by Last Updated (most recent first)
3. If only one plan exists, auto-select it
4. If multiple plans exist, **auto-select the most recently updated plan**
5. Report to user: "Refreshing plan: {plan-name} (last updated: {timestamp})"
6. If no plans exist, inform user to create with `/new`

## Step 1: Read Current Plan

Read `.spec/plans/{plan-name}/plan.md` and analyze:

- The objective and overall scope
- All phases and their tasks
- Current completion status (checked vs unchecked tasks)
- Phase completion markers (✅)

**Extract Branch Context:**
```bash
# Parse plan metadata to extract branch and worktree
PLAN_BRANCH=$(grep "^- \*\*Branch\*\*:" .spec/plans/{plan-name}/plan.md | sed 's/^- \*\*Branch\*\*: //' | sed 's/ *$//')
PLAN_WORKTREE=$(grep "^- \*\*Worktree\*\*:" .spec/plans/{plan-name}/plan.md | sed 's/^- \*\*Worktree\*\*: //' | sed 's/ *$//')
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null)
```

Store these values for use in reporting.

## Step 2: Verify Checklist Status

For each phase:

1. Count checked `[x]` vs unchecked `[ ]` tasks
2. Verify phase has ✅ marker if and only if all tasks are complete
3. Report any inconsistencies

## Step 3: Update Phase Markers

If status is inconsistent:

- Add ✅ to phase headers where all tasks are complete
- Remove ✅ from phase headers where tasks remain incomplete
- Update `.spec/plans/{plan-name}/plan.md` with corrections

## Step 4: Update README and Report Status

After updating plan.md, also update `.spec/plans/README.md`:
- Update progress stats (X/Y tasks, completion %)
- Update last updated timestamp
- If plan is fully complete (100%), optionally update status field to indicate completion

Provide a summary:

```
Plan Status: {plan-name}

Branch Context:
- Plan Branch: {PLAN_BRANCH or "(none)"}
- Current Branch: {CURRENT_BRANCH}
{if PLAN_BRANCH != CURRENT_BRANCH and PLAN_BRANCH != "(none)"}
⚠️  Warning: You're on '{CURRENT_BRANCH}' but plan is for '{PLAN_BRANCH}'
{endif}
{if PLAN_WORKTREE != "(none)"}
- Worktree: {PLAN_WORKTREE}
{endif}

Progress:
- Phase 1 - Setup Infrastructure: 5/5 complete ✅
- Phase 2 - Core Features: 3/7 complete (in progress)
- Phase 3 - Testing: 0/4 complete (not started)

Overall: 8/16 tasks complete (50%)

Updated phase markers to reflect current status.
```

If branch mismatch warning shown, add suggestion:
```
Tip: Switch to plan's branch with: git checkout {PLAN_BRANCH}
{if PLAN_WORKTREE != "(none)"}
Or work in worktree: cd {PLAN_WORKTREE}
{endif}
```

If the plan is fully complete, report completion:

```
Plan "{plan-name}" Status: All phases complete! ✅

Overall: 16/16 tasks complete (100%)

The plan is complete. Next steps:
- Run /done {plan-name} to archive this plan
- Use /new to start a new plan
```
