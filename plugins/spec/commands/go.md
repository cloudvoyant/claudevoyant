Execute or continue the existing plan using spec-driven development.

## Overview

This command executes your plan interactively, with configurable breakpoints for user review. For fully autonomous background execution, use `/bg` instead.

## Step 0: Select Plan

Check for plan name argument: `/go plan-name`

If not provided, run plan selection logic:
1. Read `.spec/plans/README.md` to get all active plans with Last Updated timestamps
2. Sort plans by Last Updated (most recent first)
3. If only one plan exists, auto-select it
4. If multiple plans exist, **auto-select the most recently updated plan**
5. Report to user: "Using plan: {plan-name} (last updated: {timestamp})"
6. If no plans exist, inform user to create with `/new`

## Step 1: Read and Analyze Plan

Read `.spec/plans/{plan-name}/plan.md` to understand:

- The objective and full scope
- All phases and their tasks
- Current progress (what's checked vs unchecked)
- Any insights from previous sessions

**Validate Plan Structure:**
- Check phase headers match format: `### Phase \d+ - .+` (e.g., "### Phase 1 - Setup")
- Check task format: `\d+\. \[(x| )\] .+` (e.g., "1. [ ] Task name")
- Verify phase numbers are sequential (1, 2, 3...)
- If validation fails, warn user and suggest using `/refresh` to check structure

## Step 1.5: Validate and Setup Worktree Context

Handle worktree-based execution automatically (same as /spec:bg):

```bash
# Get current branch and working directory
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null)
CURRENT_DIR=$(pwd)

# Parse plan metadata
PLAN_BRANCH=$(grep "^- \*\*Branch\*\*:" .spec/plans/{plan-name}/plan.md | sed 's/^- \*\*Branch\*\*: //' | sed 's/ *$//')
PLAN_WORKTREE=$(grep "^- \*\*Worktree\*\*:" .spec/plans/{plan-name}/plan.md | sed 's/^- \*\*Worktree\*\*: //' | sed 's/ *$//')

# Determine worktree status
if [ -n "$PLAN_WORKTREE" ] && [ "$PLAN_WORKTREE" != "(none)" ]; then
  if [ -d "$PLAN_WORKTREE" ]; then
    WORKTREE_EXISTS=true
  else
    WORKTREE_EXISTS=false
  fi
else
  WORKTREE_EXISTS=""
fi
```

**Case 1: Worktree exists → Auto-execute there**

If `WORKTREE_EXISTS=true`:
```
✓ Plan has worktree at: $PLAN_WORKTREE
→ Executing in worktree automatically...
```

Change to worktree directory and continue:
```bash
cd "$PLAN_WORKTREE"
```

All subsequent file operations will happen in worktree context.

**Case 2: Worktree specified but doesn't exist → Offer to create**

If `WORKTREE_EXISTS=false`:

Use **AskUserQuestion** tool:
```
question: "This plan needs worktree '$PLAN_WORKTREE' (branch: $PLAN_BRANCH) but it doesn't exist. Create it now?"
header: "Worktree Setup"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "Create worktree and execute"
    description: "Create worktree at $PLAN_WORKTREE, then start execution there"
  - label: "Execute here anyway"
    description: "Skip worktree, execute in current directory (may cause issues)"
  - label: "Cancel"
    description: "Don't execute, let me set it up manually"
```

**Handle response:**

- **"Create worktree and execute"**:
  1. Create worktree: `git worktree add -b "$PLAN_BRANCH" "$PLAN_WORKTREE" HEAD`
  2. Update .gitignore if needed
  3. Report: `✓ Created worktree at $PLAN_WORKTREE`
  4. Change to worktree: `cd "$PLAN_WORKTREE"`
  5. Continue to Step 2

- **"Execute here anyway"**:
  - Warn: `⚠️  Executing without worktree - changes will affect current branch`
  - Continue to Step 2 (execute in current directory)

- **"Cancel"**:
  - Exit command

**Case 3: No worktree for plan → Execute in current directory**

If plan has no worktree (`PLAN_WORKTREE` is "(none)" or empty):
- Check if branch matches (if `PLAN_BRANCH` specified)
- If branch mismatch, offer to switch: `git checkout $PLAN_BRANCH`
- Otherwise continue to Step 2 normally

**Result:**
- Worktree exists → Execute there automatically ✅
- Worktree missing → Offer to create ✅
- No worktree → Execute here (with branch check) ✅
- Seamless workflow, no manual steps! ✅

## Step 2: Determine Starting Point

1. Find the first unchecked task in the earliest incomplete phase
2. Report where execution will begin

Example:

```
Starting execution from Phase 2 - OAuth Integration
Next task: Configure OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
```

## Step 2.5: Validate Implementation Files

Before starting execution, verify all implementation files exist:

1. **Count phases** in plan.md:
   - Parse `.spec/plans/{plan-name}/plan.md`
   - Count lines matching: `^### Phase (\d+)`
   - Store total phase count

2. **Check each implementation file** exists:
   - For phase 1 to total phases:
     - Check `.spec/plans/{plan-name}/implementation/phase-{N}.md` exists
     - Check file size > 100 bytes (not empty)

3. **If any files missing:**
   ```
   ❌ Cannot start execution - implementation files missing!

   Missing implementation files:
   - phase-3.md
   - phase-5.md

   Implementation files are required for all phases before execution.
   These files should have been created during /spec:new.

   To fix:
   1. Create the missing files in .spec/plans/{plan-name}/implementation/
   2. Use the template structure from /spec:new Step 5.5
   3. Or recreate the plan with /spec:new

   Cannot proceed with execution.
   ```

   Exit and do not continue to Step 3.

4. **If all files exist:**
   - Report validation success:
   ```
   ✓ Validated {N} implementation files (phase-1.md through phase-{N}.md)
   ```
   - Continue to Step 3

## Step 3: Set Breakpoints

Use **AskUserQuestion** tool to configure breakpoints:

```
question: "Should Claude take breaks during execution for your review?"
header: "Breakpoints"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "None (Fully autonomous)"
    description: "Execute entire plan without stopping. Only pause on errors."
  - label: "After every phase"
    description: "Stop after each phase completes for review"
  - label: "After specific phase"
    description: "Stop after a specific phase number (will ask which one)"
```

If user selects "After specific phase", follow up with another AskUserQuestion asking which phase number.

Note the breakpoint selection in the execution plan (no need to edit plan.md)

## Step 4: Execute Spec-Driven Development Flow

For each task in the plan, follow this workflow:

### 4.1: Before Starting a Task

1. Review the task in `.spec/plans/{plan-name}/plan.md`

2. **Identify the current phase number**:
   - Find which phase header the current task is under
   - Extract phase number from header (e.g., "### Phase 3 - Testing" → phase number is 3)

3. **Validate and read the implementation file**:
   - **File path**: `.spec/plans/{plan-name}/implementation/phase-{N}.md`
   - **Validate exists**: Verify file exists before reading
   - **If missing**: This should never happen due to Step 2.5 validation, but if it does:
     ```
     ERROR: Implementation file missing for Phase {N}
     Expected: .spec/plans/{plan-name}/implementation/phase-{N}.md

     Cannot execute phase without implementation specification.
     Please create the missing file or use /spec:refresh to validate plan structure.
     ```
     Stop execution and report the error to user.
   - **If exists**: Read the entire file to understand detailed implementation requirements
   - If implementation file doesn't exist, report error and suggest user create it or check plan structure
   - Read the phase-N.md file for detailed implementation steps
   - Reference the specific task section within the implementation file (match by task number within phase)
   - Understand all requirements, files to modify, dependencies, and testing needs

### 4.2: Implement the Task & Update Plan Status In Real-Time

1. Follow the detailed specs in the implementation file precisely

2. Make necessary changes to code, configuration, or documentation as specified in the implementation file

3. **CRITICAL:** Update checkboxes in `.spec/plans/{plan-name}/plan.md` immediately as tasks complete
   - Use TodoWrite tool to track immediate work items (detailed sub-steps)
   - After updating plan.md, also update `.spec/plans/README.md`:
     - Update progress stats (X/Y tasks, completion %)
     - Update last updated timestamp

### 4.3: Pause at Phase Boundaries

When a phase is complete:

1. **CRITICAL: Run tests to validate phase completion:**

   - Run the project's test suite (`just test`, `just test-template`, or
     equivalent)
   - Verify all tests pass before marking phase complete
   - If tests fail, fix issues before proceeding
   - **Exception**: For complex refactoring, tests may be allowed to fail
     temporarily, but:
     - Document the failure reason in plan.md
     - Create specific tasks to fix tests in the next phase
     - State clearly why tests are allowed to remain broken

2. Mark phase as complete with ✅ in `.spec/plans/{plan-name}/plan.md`:

   ```markdown
   ### Phase 2 - OAuth Integration ✅
   ```

3. Update README.md with new progress and last updated timestamp

4. Before starting next phase, read the next implementation file (phase-N+1.md)

5. Report phase completion:

   ```
   Phase 2 - OAuth Integration complete! ✅

   Progress: 2/4 phases complete (50%)
   Tests: All passing ✅
   ```

## Step 5: Completion

When all phases are complete:

1. Update `.spec/plans/README.md`:
   - Update status field (may set to "Complete" or leave as "Active")
   - Update progress to 100%
   - Update last updated timestamp

2. Run `/refresh {plan-name}` to verify all checkboxes

3. Suggest running `/done {plan-name}` to archive the completed plan

4. Report completion:
   ```
   Plan "{plan-name}" execution complete! ✅

   All phases complete: X/X tasks (100%)

   Next steps:
   - Review the completed work
   - Run /done {plan-name} to archive this plan
   - Start a new plan with /new
   ```
