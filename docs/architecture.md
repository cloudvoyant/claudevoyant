# Architecture

> Design and structure of the Claudevoyant plugins

## Overview

Claudevoyant is a collection of Claude Code plugins that provide professional workflow commands for development tasks. It's organized as three specialized plugins that can be installed independently or together.

## Plugins

- claudevoyant-adr - Architecture Decision Records
- claudevoyant-dev - Development workflow (docs, review, commits)
- claudevoyant-spec - Specification-driven development (planning, upgrading)

## Design Principles

### 1. Modularity

Plugins are separated by concern (ADR, Dev, Spec) allowing users to install only what they need.

### 2. Reusability

Commands are designed to work across any project type. No language-specific assumptions are made.

### 3. Convention Over Configuration

Commands follow established patterns (conventional commits, ADRs, semantic versioning) to reduce cognitive load.

### 4. Composability

Commands can be used independently or chained together in workflows across plugins.

### 5. Documentation-Driven

All commands include comprehensive inline documentation and examples.

## Component Design

### Slash Commands

Each command is a standalone markdown file in the plugin's `commands/` directory following Claude Code's slash command format:

- Clear description and usage instructions
- Step-by-step execution workflow
- Examples and best practices
- Error handling guidance

Commands are organized by plugin:

- ADR commands (`plugins/adr/commands/`) - Focus on architectural decisions
- Dev commands (`plugins/dev/commands/`) - Focus on development workflow
- Spec commands (`plugins/spec/commands/`) - Focus on planning and execution

#### Spec Plugin: Multi-Plan Architecture

The spec plugin now supports multiple concurrent plans with organized tracking:

**Directory Structure:**
```
.spec/
└── plans/
    ├── README.md                    # Central plan tracker
    ├── {plan-name}/                 # Individual plans
    │   ├── plan.md                  # High-level plan
    │   ├── implementation/          # Detailed specs per phase
    │   │   ├── phase-1.md
    │   │   ├── phase-2.md
    │   │   └── phase-N.md
    │   └── execution-log.md
    └── archive/                     # Completed plans
        └── {plan-name}-{YYYYMMDD}/
```

**Plan Management:**
- Each plan has its own directory with plan.md and execution-log.md
- Implementation details split into separate files per phase (prevents large files)
- README.md tracks metadata for all plans (status, progress, timestamps)
- Commands accept plan name as argument or auto-select most recently updated plan
- Plans can be archived when complete or manually archived if abandoned
- Archive preserves full plan history with completion/archive date

**Plan Selection Strategy:**
- Commands like `/go` and `/bg` auto-select the most recently updated plan
- Commands like `/done` and `/delete` prompt for selection when multiple plans exist
- All commands accept optional plan name argument for direct specification

**Execution Modes:**

1. **Interactive Execution** (`/go plan-name`):
   - Step-by-step execution with user control
   - Configurable breakpoints (NONE, PHASE, SPECIFIC PHASE)
   - User reviews progress at breakpoints
   - Reads implementation files for detailed specs
   - Ideal for complex or high-risk changes

2. **Background Execution** (`/bg plan-name`):
   - Uses Claude Code's Task tool to spawn autonomous agent
   - Agent executes plan independently while user continues other work
   - Real-time progress updates in plan.md and README.md
   - Execution log in .spec/plans/{plan-name}/execution-log.md
   - Agent reads implementation files for detailed execution specs
   - Automatic pause on errors
   - Monitoring via `/status`, control via `/stop`
   - Ideal for long-running or routine tasks

**Command Updates:**
All spec commands now support plan name arguments:
- `/go <plan-name>` - Execute specific plan
- `/status <plan-name>` - Show specific plan status
- `/status` - Show all plans overview
- `/list` - List all active and archived plans
- `/archive <plan-name>` - Archive incomplete plan
- `/delete <plan-name>` - Permanently delete plan
- `/rename <old-name> <new-name>` - Rename plan

### Versioning Strategy

- Semantic versioning via conventional commits
- Automated releases through GitHub Actions
- Version synchronization across `version.txt` and `plugin.json`
- Changelog generation from commit history

### Testing Approach

- Structure validation in CI
- Plugin.json schema validation
- Marketplace.json verification
- Manual testing for command workflows

## Distribution

### Marketplace

Plugins are distributed via Claude Code marketplace:

```bash
# Add marketplace
/plugin marketplace add cloudvoyant/claudevoyant

# Install individual plugins
/plugin install adr
/plugin install dev
/plugin install spec
```

### Local Development

For development and testing:

```bash
# Add local marketplace
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/claudevoyant

# Install plugins from local source
/plugin install adr
/plugin install dev
/plugin install spec
```

## Dependencies

Development dependencies (not required for users):

- just - Command runner for automation tasks
- semantic-release - Automated versioning and releases
- Node.js - Required for semantic-release
- Git - Version control and repository management

## Extension Points

Future enhancements may include:

- Custom agents for specialized tasks
- MCP server integration for external tools
- Hooks for lifecycle events
- Skills for agent capabilities
