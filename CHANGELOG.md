## [1.11.0](https://github.com/cloudvoyant/claudevoyant/compare/v1.10.0...v1.11.0) (2026-02-22)

### Features

* add rebase and export commands, fix worktree paths, add format/lint to commit

- Add dev:rebase — intent-snapshot-driven rebase with conflict resolution,
  format/lint/test verification, and --push flag for CI monitoring
- Add spec:export — copy worktree plan to main repo .spec/plans/
- Fix spec:new hardcoded .spec/plans/ paths that ignored $PLAN_DIR in
  worktree context (steps 5.4, 5.5, 5.6)
- Add format/lint step to dev:commit (Step 1.5) before staging
- Add format/lint/test checks to dev:rebase verification (Step 5)

## [1.10.0](https://github.com/cloudvoyant/claudevoyant/compare/v1.9.0...v1.10.0) (2026-02-22)

### Features

* rename style plugin and add spec:update and style:review commands

- Rename styleguide plugin to style across all config, command files,
  and marketplace registrations
- Add spec:update command: processes @change(...) annotations inline
  in plan files without requiring flags
- Add style:review command: parallel background agents per section
  write structured REVIEW.md for follow-up agent consumption
- Add spec:new Step 5.6: iterative validation loop (min 2 rounds)
  with auto-fix using background agents
- Fix dev:commit: push and monitor CI automatically; add --no-push flag

## [1.9.0](https://github.com/cloudvoyant/claudevoyant/compare/v1.8.0...v1.9.0) (2026-02-19)

### Features

* create plans inside worktree for complete isolation

When using --branch flag, plan now lives in the worktree:
- Before: .spec/plans/my-plan/ (main repo)
- After: .worktrees/branch/.spec/plans/my-plan/ (in worktree)

Benefits:
- Complete isolation - everything for feature in one place
- cd to worktree and run /spec:bg directly
- Delete worktree = delete plan (clean)
- Clearer context - you're IN the feature directory

Workflow:
1. /spec:new my-feature --branch feature-x
2. cd .worktrees/feature-x/
3. /spec:bg my-feature (works! plan is here)
4. Make changes, all isolated

Plans without worktrees still go in main repo as before.

## [1.8.0](https://github.com/cloudvoyant/claudevoyant/compare/v1.7.1...v1.8.0) (2026-02-18)

### Features

* add --yes flag to skip confirmations in commands

Add --yes/-y flag support for non-interactive execution:

/dev:commit --yes:
- Skip commit message approval
- Auto-push and verify CI
- Perfect for CI/CD and scripts

/spec:bg --yes:
- Auto-create missing worktree
- Skip execution confirmation
- Start immediately

This enables fully automated workflows without manual confirmation steps.

## [1.7.1](https://github.com/cloudvoyant/claudevoyant/compare/v1.7.0...v1.7.1) (2026-02-13)

### Bug Fixes

* prevent bg agent from asking questions mid-execution

Background agents should execute ALL phases autonomously without
asking for permission to continue. Added explicit instructions to:
- Never ask "Should I continue?" or "Want me to proceed?"
- Automatically move between phases
- Only stop on actual errors, not for user approval

This fixes agents stopping after each phase and asking if user
wants to continue.

## [1.7.0](https://github.com/cloudvoyant/claudevoyant/compare/v1.6.1...v1.7.0) (2026-02-13)

### Features

* auto-handle worktrees in spec execution commands

Seamless worktree workflow:
- Automatically execute in worktree if it exists (no manual cd)
- Offer to create worktree if missing (one-step setup)
- Handle all cases: exists, missing, or not needed

Changes:
- /spec:bg and /spec:go now detect worktree from plan metadata
- If worktree exists, automatically cd and execute there
- If worktree specified but missing, prompt to create it
- Agent executes with correct directory context
- No more manual "cd .worktrees/branch && /spec:bg" steps

This makes worktree-based development fully automatic.

## [1.6.1](https://github.com/cloudvoyant/claudevoyant/compare/v1.6.0...v1.6.1) (2026-02-13)

### Bug Fixes

* remove redundant questions from commit CI monitoring

Automatically monitor CI after push without asking additional questions.
User gets one prompt (push + verify?) then monitoring happens automatically.

Before: Ask to push → ask to monitor → monitor
After: Ask to push → automatically monitor

Reduces friction and makes workflow faster.

## [1.6.0](https://github.com/cloudvoyant/claudevoyant/compare/v1.5.0...v1.6.0) (2026-02-13)

### Features

* optimize commit command and add automatic CI verification

Speed improvements:
- Use conversation context instead of re-reading git logs
- Skip redundant file reads when context is available
- Eliminate unnecessary git log lookups

New functionality:
- Automatically offer to push and verify CI after commit
- Monitor GitHub Actions workflows to ensure changes pass
- Only declare work complete after CI validates changes
- Gracefully handle repos without CI or gh CLI

This addresses the issue where Claude declares work "done" without
verifying that tests, builds, and other automated checks actually pass.

## [1.5.0](https://github.com/cloudvoyant/claudevoyant/compare/v1.4.2...v1.5.0) (2026-02-12)

### Features

* add GitHub Actions monitoring skill to dev plugin

Add /dev:actions command that monitors CI/CD workflows to verify
changes pass automated checks. Prevents declaring work "done" when
tests, builds, or other workflows are failing.

Features:
- Check status of recent workflow runs
- Wait for in-progress workflows to complete
- Display pass/fail status with timing
- Fetch and show error logs on failure
- Offer to help fix issues when workflows fail

## [1.4.2](https://github.com/cloudvoyant/claudevoyant/compare/v1.4.1...v1.4.2) (2026-02-12)

### Bug Fixes

* remove invalid commands field from styleguide plugin manifest

Commands are auto-discovered from the commands/ directory and should
not be declared in plugin.json. This was causing validation errors
during plugin installation.

## [1.4.1](https://github.com/cloudvoyant/claudevoyant/compare/v1.4.0...v1.4.1) (2026-02-12)

### Bug Fixes

* move styleguide plugin to correct structure for marketplace

Moves plugin.json to .claude-plugin/ subdirectory and adds styleguide
to marketplace index. Plugin was not discoverable due to incorrect
file structure.

layout with all plugins under a single plugins/ parent directory.
Updates marketplace.json source paths accordingly.

## [1.1.1](https://github.com/cloudvoyant/claudevoyant/compare/v1.1.0...v1.1.1) (2025-11-16)

### Bug Fixes

* use relative paths in marketplace.json for monorepo structure

Changes plugin sources from GitHub object format to relative paths,
following Anthropic's recommended pattern for monorepo marketplaces.
Also corrects outdated plugin name in README installation example.

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/cloudvoyant/claudevoyant/compare/v1.0.3...v1.1.0) (2025-11-16)

### Features

* restructure into three plugins and add repository diff command

Splits monolithic plugin into specialized plugins:
- claudevoyant-adr: Architecture Decision Records
- claudevoyant-dev: Development workflows (docs, review, commits, diff)
- claudevoyant-spec: Specification-driven development

Adds new /diff command to compare repositories and generate
comprehensive diff reports with insights and analysis.

Updates marketplace.json to reference three separate plugins
with individual paths and descriptions.


### Bug Fixes

* remove claudevoyant prefix from plugin names

Fixes plugin installation by ensuring plugin names match between
marketplace.json and individual plugin.json files. Removes the
obsolete root plugin.json as the repository now contains three
separate plugins (adr, dev, spec).

* update semantic-release config for multi-plugin structure

Updates semantic-release to handle three separate plugins (adr, dev, spec)
instead of single root plugin. Simplifies commit command documentation
by removing redundant verification steps.
